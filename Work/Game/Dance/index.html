            This is another solo project that I did over my internship at the Mercury Lab in Beijing. This project was later chosen by Panasonic and used its technique on its exihibiton at Beijng. 
            <br>
            Tools:
            <br>
            Kinect and Unity
            <br>
            Kinect was used as a joint sensor to detect the joints of people standing in front of the camera. For this project, kinect is detecting all joints of a person, and then is passing in the data into the model to sync its movement. 
            <br>
            Gameplay:
            <br>
            Stand in front of the camera and start dancing! or just stand in front of the camera. Do whatever! Be creative!
