        <p class = "aboutText"> Hi! I’m Sarah — a technical artist and indie game developer with a passion for building interactive experiences that are playful, expressive, and fun. I completed both my bachelor's and master’s degrees in Integrated Design and Media, with a minor in math, at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
            I specialize in designing and developing games and art installations using engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. I love turning ideas into tangible, responsive, and most importantly, fun experiences.
            <br>
            <br>
            Beyond game development, I’m also a sound designer and composer. My music background (I’ve played piano since I was 3!) deeply informs how I design audio that feels emotionally and spatially in sync with the visuals. I also play flute and cello, and have performed in venues like Carnegie Hall and Helix Theatre with orchestras and bands around the world.
            <br>
